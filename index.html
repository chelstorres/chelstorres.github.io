Bio~
</h3>
I was born and raised in San Jose California. I will be a senior this upcoming fall. I am nervous about applying to college, but more than anything I am excited for my last year of highschool. More than anything, I love traveling. My favorite place in the entire world is my mother’s birthplace: Colima, Mexico. In the future, I definitely hope to explore other countries with my loved ones.

I love dogs. I have a pitbull myself. People tend to generalize and believe that pitbulls are the scariest and most aggressive dogs, but in reality, they are the sweetest. My dog just turned 3, but he’s still my baby.

The ocean!! I hate going to the beach primarily because of the ocean. There is so much water and over 90 percent of the ocean's body is unknown so you never know what's really down there...
